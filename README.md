# Oracle JET
## How to create an OJET Application using VDOM

This application is a template to start and contains:
- component to display a Header
- component to display a Footer
- component to display a Content
- A login page

This Repository will not be maintened, even if Oracle Jet is a great library, I have moved all my development to React and MUI for components
